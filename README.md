## AirBnB clone
	The goal of AirBnB clone project is to deploy on server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.
	All the features won't be implemented, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

#### The console
	The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system.
	This storage engine will give us an abstraction between "My object" and "How they are stored and persisted".
	This means: from the console code and from the front-end and RestAPI, we won't have to pay attention of how objects are stored.
	This abstraction will also allow us to change the type of storage easily without updating all of our codebase.
	**The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine.**
